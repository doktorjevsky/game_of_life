# game_of_life

A fun project for learning C.
Works on a Windows cpu.

Compile and run program:
If you have "make" enabled, simply go to the directory of the source code and type:
   make
   anim.exe
If not:
   gcc -Wall anim_main.c game_of_life.c -o anim
   anim.exe
   
   
To exit program, type "-1".
The initialization of the program is often boring. You can input a line of integers while the 
program is running to spring theese cells to life.
